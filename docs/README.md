# CAT NITRO IS DISABLED until exams are over

It has been decided to make the unlitmate decision to disable cat nitro for the week before exams have start.

It is like this because really should focus on studying. We will make it work before and after school, mabye during lunch and snack it will work but for the most part it will be disabled and bring you to this page.
When year 7 exams are over I will put the website back up with 100% uptime. :))
